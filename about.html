            <p>Ontario's Couples Resort is on the shores of Galeairy Lake, which mostly is in <a href="AlgonquinPark.html" style="color: red;">Algonquin Park</a> and the Madawaska River. The village of Whitney, Ontario is a short 15-minute walk away. Algonquin Park being our backyard, we are surrounded with breathtaking wilderness, pure fresh air, secluded forests, pristine waters, an abundance of sunny days, and a blanket of stars at night.</p>        </section>

            <p>FYI * #1 Romantic Resort in Ontario.  Defined by when we were paying TripAdvisor over $10,000 a year to belong to them they rated us #1 in Ontario. The moment we stopped paying them the annual fee we were completely dropped from their list. We refuse to have TripAdvisor use Extortion on us to belong to their listings.  Yet TripAdvisor continues to still publish the reviews, and this is ethically just wrong as they are using their Power to Punish us and this is Blackmail.  Hope you agree with us.</p>

                    <p>Gertrud Sorensen - Artist:
                        Gertrud Sorensen is an Austrian-born Canadian. After a successful business career with Danish husband Fritz, at The Bear Trail Couples Resort, she became our resident artist. Gertrud presently operates an extensive art studio with over 30 paintings in her gallery. https://www.gertrudsorensen.com</p>
                        <p>
                            The four Algonquin seasons are portrayed with varying moods in vibrant colours on her canvases. Having learned from Poul Thrane, David Armstrong, Gladys Ewing, Mary Lampman and Ron Leonard, it is easy to appreciate how they and the nature of Algonquin Park have influenced Gertrud's art.
                            
                            Visit Gertrud's on-site studio while you are here and enjoy her artwork. Wander in and watch a canvas come to life. Take home a special gift to remember a romantic honeymoon or a joyous occasion as many of our guests from around the world have done.

                            Take a historical photo journey in one of the first cabins built on the property when it was known as the Bear Trail Inn to the present day Couples Resort.
                            The resort has enjoyed a long and memorable history since 1967, when the Sorensen family purchased the property.
                            The Couples Resort will be an experience that you look back on with many memories. It is these memories that keep guests returning.</p>
