            <h2 class="hidden">About Algonquin Park</h2>
            <p>Algonquin Park, the first provincial park in Ontario, protected from the noise and rush of civilization, this world-renowned park in Ontario is a sanctuary for the rugged beauty of the maple, pine, moose, and wolves. A Provincial Park since 1893, the 7500 square kilometers (3500 square miles) of Algonquin Park are home to a diverse and unblemished eco-system that can be found nowhere else on earth.</p>
            <p>Glaciers that receded ten thousand years ago created the distinctive rock outcroppings and spring-fed lakes of Algonquin. These mountains of ice have left the park with a rough, stark beauty. This, combined with its location, 3 hours northeast of Toronto and 2 1/2 hours west of Ottawa makes Algonquin an ideal attraction for those looking to escape the hustle of the city.</p>
            <p>This majestic park, minutes away and seen from our lakeshore, is awe-inspiring and completely peaceful with the incredible beauty of nature. Come experience the Algonquin grandeur, with all its fresh clean air, deep blue skies, rich green forests and hundreds of pristine lakes. It is impressive.</p>
            <p>Algonquin park just steps away from The Couples Resort, Algonquin's 7,630 square kilometres of forests, lakes, and rivers have assumed an almost incalculable importance as a living link with a vanishing past.
                Ontario's Algonquin Park and Area has more than 30 species of mammals, many are nocturnal or mostly subterranean and therefore not encountered. Listed are most commonly seen mammals, birds and reptilesin the Algonquin Park & Area.</p>
                <p>Visit Algonquin and hear for the first and only time in your lives the mournful howl of a wolf? See first-hand — in Algonquin and nowhere else — a reasonable facsimile of the wilderness that once covered all of Ontario?</p>
